# Air_Quality_Analysis_Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality across various cities in India, focusing on pollution levels for specific pollutants such as CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO (Nitric Oxide), PM2.5 (Particulate Matter), and SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide). The dashboard visualizes city-wise pollution data, top and least polluted cities, and trends in Air Quality Index (AQI) over time.

## Problem Statement
With increasing industrialization and urbanization, monitoring air quality is critical for public health. This project aims to:
1. Identify cities with the highest and lowest pollution levels.
2. Analyze AQI trends over the years.
3. Provide insights into pollutant concentration averages to better understand urban air quality.

## Tools Used
1. Microsoft Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
2. Data Sources: Air quality data collected for various pollutants and cities from CSV file.
3. Microsoft Bing Maps: Integrated for geographical visualization of AQI data.

## Insights
### Top 3 Polluted Cities:
* Ahmedabad: Highest average AQI of 452.52
* Delhi: AQI of 259.60
* Patna: AQI of 241.00
  
### Least Polluted Cities:
* Coimbatore: AQI of 73.08.
* Shillong: AQI of 53.82.
* Aizawl: Lowest AQI of 34.90.
  
### AQI Trend Analysis:
There is a consistent decline in AQI from 2015 (212.74) to 2020 (113.47), suggesting improvements in air quality over time.
Average Pollutant Concentration:

CO: 2.38
NO: 17.85
PM2.5: 67.45
SO2: 14.04
